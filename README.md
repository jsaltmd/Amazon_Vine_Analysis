# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Within this big data and Hadoop context, we'll cover MapReduce and how it has improved the process for handling big data. We'll then move on to PySpark, which has become the leading technology for handling big data. After diving into some of the technologies used with big data, we'll look at natural language processing (NLP) in relation to big data. We'll close with an introduction to cloud services. Cloud services let us store large amounts of data at remote locations rather than locally, on top of many other services. This allows for more scalability and performance. We'll use the most popular cloud service available: Amazon Web Services (AWS).
